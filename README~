*****************************************************************

This folder contains all relevant material to reproduce plots 
and results in the paper above. We assume that the associated R
package 'cfdr' is loaded. If it is not, use

library(devtools)
install.github("jamesliley/cfdr")

In some areas (mostly large-scale simulations), the complete 
regeneration of all data used in the paper takes a prohibitively 
long time to produce. For this reason, we include a script which
generates a single run of the simulation, and a matrix of results
from previous runs.

In all processes involving random number generation, we set a 
random seed explicitly. For this reason, all results should match
those in the text exactly.

Simulations are shared with those for our second paper, 'New 
estimators for conditional false discovery rates improve power 
and smoothness'. Some columns of the data matrix will appear 
redundant for this reason.

In this guide, we will outline the subdirectories in this folder,
then run through what each script does, and what each data object
contains.

*****************************************************************

This folder contains four subdirectories
 code: contains R scripts
 outputs: contains figures included in the manuscript (as PDFs) 
   and tables of results
 simulations: contains example simulation output
 data: contains datasets used for analysis

*****************************************************************

Folder 'code' contains two files:
code/run_simulation.R: runs a single iteration of the simulation,
 given a random seed
code/analysis_estimation.R: given a matrix of simulation results 
 and GWAS data, generates tables and draws plots as pdfs to 
 'outputs' directory

*****************************************************************

Folder 'data' contains three objects. These are explained in the
README in ./data.
